Very much a work in progress, so far it does.. store your api key securely! 
more to come when i bother doing it.

things i need to do
- [x] handle api keys
- [ ] store whatever link is used to ask, check performance guides if there is a benefit to use an ip or somethnig
- [ ] handle different models.
- [ ] see if you can steal some code from https://github.com/kagisearch/ask/tree/main or you know, just make your own thing. i suck at AI stuff so all the prompt stuff is probaly nice to grab.
